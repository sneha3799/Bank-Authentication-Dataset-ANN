# Bank-Authentication-Dataset-ANN

We will use the Bank Authentication Data Set to start off with. This data set consists of various image features derived from images that had 400 x 400 pixels. You should note the data itself that we will be using ARE NOT ACTUAL IMAGES, they are features of images.
Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.

Attribute Information:

variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous),
skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous),
curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous),
entropy of image (continuous),
class (integer)
